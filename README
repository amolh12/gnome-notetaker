This is just a simple note taking application written using python and gtk3 (screenshot is included). Objectives of this project are quite simple,

run the code with
$ python ./notetaker.py

1) Give a notes directory it shows the existing files with (.txt) extensions in the side pane (file extension is not shown).

2) On selecting a particular note, it will display the same in the textview. If notes is edited, then it will be get saved automatically.

3) One can easily sync notes across various machines using Dropbox or Ubuntu One.

4) Similar application called 'Epistle' is available for Android, which displays the text files from Dropbox folder.

5) When running for the first time it will ask for creating a notes directory (config file), which can be done by clicking setting button and selecting a notes directory. (for this alpha version of the application, I would suggest to keep some files with .txt extensions in the folder you will choose
as your notes directory)

So in short with this note taking application one can sync the notes across all devices including Android Phone (dont know about Apple products).

So things to be still done :

1) Saving method is not fully implemented yet. Currently it will only save the edited notes when you
select some other notes, so this needs to be resolved and automatic saving say after each 5 seconds along with save on quit is to be included.

2) Add note function is not implemented yet. Being my knowledge of Python and GTK is just 5 days old, I am getting how one can add new note in TreeView (without poping up new window).

3) Some UI improvements are also needed. (Least Priority)


Looking forward for your help guys for making this a success.
